= Parent Project for my talks.

Originally intended as a parent module it is currently more of a template for slides written in AsciiDoc and rendered using Reveal.js.

== How to use

* Copy the project.
* Edit the `pom.xml`.
    You probably want to change
    * `artefactId`
    * `name`
    * `description`
    * and if you are not me also the `groupid`
* start editing `src/main/asciidoc/talk.ad`
* run `mvn clean package && open docs/talk.html`

Note that the slides get copied in the `docs` folder.
You can push that onto GitHub and use GitHub pages to make it available to everybody.

Of course, again if you are not me, you might want to tweak the theme, `self.ad` and all kinds of things.

== Rational

If you do talks often you might know the situation:
There are a dozen variations of the same talks sitting in a directory.
And you have no idea what the differences are and on which one you should base the next presentation.

As software developers we know a solution to this: Version Control.

But this means Power Point doesn't really work.
Also it is a pain in the ass to begin with.
Keynote is supposed to be better, but I already decided on a different tool when I started working on a Mac.

My tool of choice is Reveal.js created from AsciiDoc.
This has a couple of benefits:

* My slides have the same style all the time
* I can create my slides in a text editor or my IDE
* I can properly use tools like diff

Of course there are also drawbacks:

* Many things that should be easy aren't
* There is now a whole shopping list of technologies to deal with

I solve this with a build tool.
I started with Gradle but since I almost exclusively work with Maven at my job I switched to Maven.

The result is this repository.
It is the basis for my current and upcoming talks.
